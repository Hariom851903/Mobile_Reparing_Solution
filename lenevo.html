Introduction of Lenovo Lenovo is a multinational company that began its operations as a small company, New Technology Developer, Inc.  The company became well known for the Legend Chinese character card which assisted consumers in translating non-Chinese operating systems into the standard Chinese language. The portfolio expanded in the 1990s with direct competitors such as Dell commanding 17.9% of the market share. Hewlett Packard and IBM followed close behind; however, none of the companies mastered the personal computing (PC) business model until the early 2000s.

This synergy proved to be mediocre as many people still thought of the ThinkPad separate and apart from Lenovo. Lenovo was faced with its merger with IBM  the cultural and operational clash. Between IBM and Lenovo, globally Lenovo sales were mostly in China and IBM had a strong customer base around the world with little footprint in China. Many changes within the organization internally were made. English became the company’s language and conference calls were scheduled in the early morning or late at night due to 12-hour difference between Lenovo’s headquarters in Beijing and IBM’s in the US
